My favorite food is pizza. I love all types of pizza, but being from the Chicago area I am
<br>biased toward deep-dish. I like most toppings but usally stick to the basics.

Favorite Pizza Places
</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>
	For Deep Dish
	</dt>
	<dd>- Lou Malnati's: famous Chicago pizzeria serving up my favorite deep-dish pizza. They
	<br>have locations in Wisconsin so if you want to try deep-dish I highly recommend them</dd>
	<dt>
	For Thin Crust
	</dt>
	<dd>-Ian's: located right here in Madison every student knows about it. Not the greatest 
	<br>in the world, but great after a long night out. I enjoy their Smokey the Bandit slice.</dd>
	<dt>
	For Chain Pizza
	</dt>
	<dd>-Papa John's: inexpensive, fast pizza that is located everywhere and tastes decent.</dd>
