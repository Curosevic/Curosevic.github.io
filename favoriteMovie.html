<p>My favorite movie is Hacksaw Ridge. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/">Hacksaw Ridge IMBd.</a> 
It came out in 2016 and was highly received by critics and viewers alike. I loved the movie because it deals with war
and I enjoy war movies. The story is also amazing and they did a wonderful job telling it. Garfield's acting as well as the 
rest of the cast is phenomenal.

<p>The movie is based on a true story of Desmond Doss who was a medic at the Battle of Okinawa. Desmond was very religious and did
not believe in killing people even during war. This meant he went into battle without weapons and saved over fifty people throughout 
this battle. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery.</p>
