My favorite sport is hockey and being from Illinois my favorite sports team is the Chicago Blackhawks. 
<br>This team has alot of history as it is an original six team. The Blackhawks have won six championships
<br>in thier history with three coming since 2010. My favorite player on the team is the captain Jonathan 
<br>Toews.
